I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park, advised by [Prof Prakash Narayan](https://user.eng.umd.edu/~prakash/index.html). Before coming to UMD, I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering from IIT Kanpur in 2019, where I was advised by [Prof Adrish Banerjee](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~adrish/). During this time, I also spent a summer at CUHK, working with [Prof Sidharth Jaggi](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/sidharth-sid-jaggi) on adversarial channels, and a semester working with [Prof Rajat Mittal](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/rmittal/) on quantum query complexity.

I co-organize the [Communication, Control and Signal Processing Seminar](http://ccsp.ece.umd.edu/).
